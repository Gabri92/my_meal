# MyMeal 🍽️ – Reduce Food Waste, One Meal at a Time

**MyMeal** is a mobile app prototype developed to help individuals manage their pantry, reduce domestic food waste, and save time and money through smarter meal planning and tracking.

This project was part of a broader initiative to validate and solve a real-world sustainability problem using lean startup and product discovery techniques.

## 🚀 Overview

**Problem**: Domestic food waste is a massive issue — in Italy alone, over €9 billion worth of food is wasted yearly.  
**Solution**: MyMeal helps users manage their kitchen by tracking expiration dates, suggesting meal plans, and creating shopping lists — all from a simple, user-friendly mobile interface.

## 🧠 Key Features

- Digital pantry management
- Food expiration tracking with alerts
- Weekly meal planner
- Shopping list generation

## 📱 Tech Stack

- **Flutter** – Cross-platform mobile framework
- **Dart** – Language used for Flutter development
- **Firebase** – For authentication and backend
- **Figma** – For UI/UX prototyping

---

## 🧪 Validation Process

The app was born from a structured product discovery process:
- 130+ survey responses collected and analyzed
- User personas and JTBD defined
- Market and competitor analysis (TAM/SAM/SOM)
- Pitch deck and business plan prepared
